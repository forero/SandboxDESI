Title: The expected cosmic web from DESI   

Abstract: 
We explore the expected results of the cosmic web finding techniques on galaxies from DESI.
The goal of the project is to describe how well estable are the cosmic web elements (voids, filaments, walls and clusters) 
as the survey progresses. Primarely we want to asses the impact of the fiber assignment incompleteness and survey strategy.
