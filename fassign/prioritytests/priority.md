* T. is working on refactoring the order of assignments to loop through targets based on priority, instead of looping through fibers.  This might fix #151, #179. 
* tickets #237 and #152 are flagged as "onsky", but I don't know if they really are a problem anymore or not.  Please check.
* Please also check if #232 is a real problem.  I suspect it is just a bug in qa-fiberassign, that may have already been fixed with an update to desimodel.
* Please remind me of the status of your "canonical fiberassign runs" tests. 
* It seems you were almost finished with that and then I got distracted by commissioning. Or any other tickets, including figuring out if any of those can be closed.
