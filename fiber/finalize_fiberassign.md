Fiber assignment uses required fraction of fibers IN.DAT-7002 . 
Author: Jaime Forero-Romero  
Status: FINALIZE  
Rationale: All fibers are assigned either to science targets, sky fibers and standard stars. This has been verified with real imaging catalogs.  

**Need updated documentation.**

Fiber assignment provides sufficient calibration fibers IN.DAT-7003   
Author: Jaime Forero-Romero   
Status: FINALIZE  
Rationale: This is done for sky fibers. Standard stars need updated cuts to have enough density.   

** Need a report; could/should be same report as for the previous entry.**
