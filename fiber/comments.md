1. In the introduction. "there will be a similar issue, caused by limitations in the palcemente of fibers close to each other".  
    This is imprecise. The issue is the collision of the positioners that could happen even if the fibers are far from each other.  
    See Cell 12 for an example of positioner collision where the fibers are far apart https://github.com/forero/SandboxDESI/blob/master/fiber/PositionerShape.ipynb
