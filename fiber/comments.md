1. In the introduction. "there will be a similar issue, caused by limitations in the palcemente of fibers close to each other".  
    This is imprecise. The issue is the collision of the positioners that could happen even if the fibers are far from each other.  
    See Cell 12 for an example of positioner collision where the fibers are far apart https://github.com/forero/SandboxDESI/blob/master/fiber/PositionerShape.ipynb
    
2. In Section 2. It should also be mentioned that an ELG can remain witout a fiber because there are two more classes of targets (LRG, QSO) in competition for the fibers. This is implicit in Table 1, but is not explicitly mentioned that the efficiency depends on the 
local density of all three galaxy types LRG, QSO, ELG.
