###  User Interface 
* [x] Missing positioner data or tile definitions should be logged #77.  
* [x] cleanup features files #23.  
* [x] cleaner user interface #89.  
* [ ] Standard star DESI_TARGET mask in features file #64.  
* [ ] re-add optional config file #108

### Data Structures 
* [x] Guide/Focus/Alignment targets #94.  
* [x] Sky Camera positions #95.  
* [x] Accounting for broken fibers and stuck positioners. #92.  
* [ ] add light trap assignments #42. 
* [ ] add inner exclusion radius for fiber patrol area #98
* [ ] add constructor for class target #8.

### Algorithm
* [x] fill unused fibers with stdstars and sky #82.  
* [ ] Priorities for standard stars #78.  
* [ ] Swapping logic flexibility #93.  
* [ ] don't assign stdstar and sky next to each other on CCD #97.  
* [ ] fiberassign on arbitrary pointings #99

### Sofware testing
* [ ] fiberassign doesn't produce reproducible results #31.  
* [ ] fiberassign crashes valgrind. #35.  
* [ ] Python code to check for collisions #91.  

### Bookkeeping (15, 16, 17) (Deadline May 12)
* [ ] track targets that got added by later optimization passes #3.  
* [ ] Output row index in input target list #51 . 
* [ ] propagating input target information #96.  
* [ ] unassigned fibers RA, dec, x, y #109
